# Measurement Databases

!!!
Below is a collection of several measurement databases and projects, with descriptions and detailed analyses of their pros and cons.
!!!

## [Squig.link](https://squig.link/) (711)
Arguably the largest collection of measurements (both 711 and 5128), it contains the databases of several people/groups for IEMs, headphones, and earbuds. There are also several useful features, such as the Equalizer tab that allows for many types of EQ, the ability to alter the y-axis, the whole top row, etc. The quality of the measurements is very variable, with some databases having very consistent and thorough procedures and calibrations with the Δ5128 project; others are done inconsistently, with different couplers and units, all jumbled up.

The measurements should only be used with reference with others in the same database.

Pros | Cons | 
:-:|:-:|
**Largest database of measurements** | Inconsistent measurement quality and procedure |
Feature-packed website | Inconsistent feature implementation |
Downloadable measurements |  |

## [oratory1990](https://www.reddit.com/r/oratory1990/wiki/index/list_of_presets/) (711)
Mostly focused on headphone measurements, but IEM measurements are also available and are measured using a HATS. Relatively sparse and measurements are not available for download or modification, but are of very high quality.

Pros | Cons | 
:-:|:-:|
**Very high quality measurements** | Measurements only available in PDFs |
Some HATS-based measurements | Some HATS-based measurement |
  | Relatively small database |

***
## [Hangout.Audio](https://graph.hangout.audio/) (5128 & 711)
Now part of the squig.link collection, they are the biggest single databases in both of their respective standards. It is also used as a reference for the Δ5128 project. The same features from squig.link are also here as they both use the same software. Measurements are not downloadable and are hosted on their end instead of on squig.link.

Pros | Cons | 
:-:|:-:|
Generally high quality measurements | Non-downloadable measurements |
Large database |  |
Feature-packed website | |


***
## [Woodenears](https://www.woodenears.com/) (5128 & 711)
Measurements using HATS for both frequency response as well as distortion. Everything is in Korean, and the collection is relatively large with slow, inconsistent updates.

Pros | Cons | 
:-:|:-:|
High quality measurements | Inconsistent and slow updates |
Large database | Korean website |
Distortion measurements | Non-downloadable measurements |
| Not many features |

***
## [AudioScienceReview (ASR)](https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?Audio+Reviews/) (711)
Measurements using a HATS for frequency response, distortion, group delay, impedance, and sensitivity. Very limited database, with all of the data shown as pictures.

Pros | Cons | 
:-:|:-:|
Extensive measurement types | Limited database  |
 | Non-downloadable data |
 | No additional features |

***
## [Headphones.com](https://headphones.com/blogs/reviews) (5128 & 711)
Small collection of measurements but spread out across many sources (videos, forums, websites, etc) with no consistent method of searching them. Large variety in terms of presentation, measurement rig, and procedure. Most new measurements are compensated to a specific curve/target, and some display insertion depth profile.

Pros | Cons | 
:-:|:-:|
High quality measurements | Compensated measurements |
HATS-based measurement | HATS-based measurement |
Different measurement types  | Hard to find measurements |
 | Non-downloadable data |
 | Inconsistent measurement procedures and rigs |

***
## [Earphones Archive](https://earphonesarchive.squig.link/) (5128 & 711)
Relatively small collection of 5128 measurements. Additional data can be found on their blog.

Pros | Cons | 
:-:|:-:|
HATS-based measurement | HATS-based measurement |
Relatively large 5128 database | Korean website |
Extensive measurement types |  |
(Indirectly) Downloadable data |  |

***
## [Realab](https://www.realab.com/category/earphones) (5128)
Small collection of high quality measurements for IEMs in Chinese.

Pros | Cons | 
:-:|:-:|
HATS-based measurement | HATS-based measurement |
Different measurement types  | Non-downloadable data |
 | Hard to find measurements |
 | Chinese website |
 | Limited database |
 
***
## [HypeTheSonics](https://www.hypethesonics.com/) (5128 & 711)
Small collection of IEM (5128 & 711) and DAP measurements. They are also responsible for the coupler research project with the ER2SE.

Pros | Cons | 
:-:|:-:|
High quality measurements | Limited database |
HATS-based measurement | HATS-based measurement |
Different measurement types  | Non-downloadable data |
Other databases and projects |  |

***
## [Rtings](https://www.rtings.com/headphones) (5128 & 711)

Very large collection of measurements in both 711 and 5128. High quality measurements, but some tests and every score must be ignored. 

Pros | Cons | 
:-:|:-:|
High quality measurements | Compensated measurements |
HATS-based measurement | HATS-based measurement |
Different measurement types  | Non-downloadable data |
Large database | |

***
## [Soundguys](https://www.soundguys.com/) (5128 & 711)
Large overall collection, but very little IEM measurements in favor of headphones and TWS. 5128 measurements present but even smaller smaller collection of measurements. Scores should be ignored. 

Pros | Cons | 
:-:|:-:|
Different measurement types | Compensated measurements |
HATS-based measurement | HATS-based measurement |
 | Non-downloadable data |
 | Inconsistent measurement procedures and rigs |
 
***
## [PEQdB](https://peqdb.com/) (5128 & 711)

A scrape of available measurements from squig.link, but without any of the categorization or separation. To be avoided for the most part as other measurement are as accessible while still being traceable. 

Pros | Cons | 
:-:|:-:|
Large database| **Extremely inconsistent measurement quality and procedure**  |
Downloadable measurements |  |
Feature-packed website |  |
