# Ideal spatial rendering and sound localization (\*\*\*\*\*)
The perfect audio experience with IEMs would be one where actual sound localization is perfected, and where transparency relative to real life has been achieved. Bypassing the regular headphone/IEM stereophonic limitations and crossing into full spatial rendering of audio is arguably the goal, and for what is arguably the best possible audio experience that is accomplishable on IEMs, it will require enormous amounts of ingenuity, as well as a shift in the music production industry. 

We can only wait until more studies, discoveries, and innovations happen before such a goal becomes accessible, easy-to-use, and effective. For now, there are a few key elements that have to be perfected, as well as a few others that will have to be studied to better understand their possible effects.

!!! Key elements
- Full in-situ response at the eardrum will have to be mapped out and corrected properly
- Extensive HRTF data of the user will have to be measured to a high enough accuracy for proper response calibration
- ITD/ILD factors will have to be considered and implemented correctly for the user
- Object-based audio should become widespread, ideally avoiding the circle of confusion. Stereophonic audio will be fine as well but should be considered when rendering the spatial environment
- Occlusion effects, physical sensation of the IEMs, and discrepancy between real-life vs recorded environments should ideally be studied to ascertain their impacts on localization and preference
