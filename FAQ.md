# FAQ

*I can't hear the difference between EQ presets, am I doing something wrong?*
Check to see if you setup your EQ app properly, and if you routed your audio correctly. If everything is correct but you are still struggling to hear a difference, then either your EQ preset doesn't impart meaningful changes, or your listening ability is not up to par. 


*What does it mean for an IEM to respond well to EQ?*
For that specific user, it usually means that the EQ is working as he intends. Truth is that most IEMs "respond" excellently to EQ, with very minimal distortion being introduced. The concept of EQ responsiveness most likely came from changes done through EQ that didn't match expectations, and is most likely correlated to FR misinterpretation.


*Can EQ cause mechanical/electrical failure?*
IEMs are much more robust than one might think. EQ used in the guide will never cause any failure. EQ used throughout the guide is software, and is completely reversible. 


*What about driver quality?*
"Driver quality" is used as a direct synonym to "technicalities" in the audiophile community. Driver quality as used in the community should instead refer to FR, but also other properties such as distortion, efficiency, leakage tolerance, reliability/channel matching/QC, etc. 


*How do I train my listening ability?*
There aren't any proper standards concerning listening ability, and what training that is available and aimed at such a goal can vary depending on the many factors like geographical location, field of study/practice, and more. 
As far as listening ability is gauged in the community as well as in studies on preference as seen with Harman, the "How To Listen" (HTL) program is used. Harman's research classes listeners into two groups: trained and untrained listeners, with the former having completed the required exercises to a certain level. Previously, trained listeners were required to pass level 8 on all exercises; nowadays, only the peaks/dips exercise is needed, with the rest having been substituted for training documents for the listener to read.
Other programs also employ similar forms of exercises, mainly incorporating the peaks/dips one, such as eqTrainer and AudioBan.


*Who are you?*
None of your business, and no one you know.

*What IEMs do you like or use?*
Anything that isn't broken and is comfortable.
