# Measurement Databases

Below is a collection of several measurement databases and projects, with descriptions and detailed analyses of their pros and cons.

## Squig.link (711)

Arguably the largest collection of measurements (both 711 and 5128), it contains the databases of several people/groups for IEMs, headphones, and earbuds. There are also several useful features, such as the Equalizer tab that allows for many types of EQ, the ability to alter the y-axis, the whole top row, etc. The quality of the measurements is very variable, with some databases having very consistent and thorough procedures and calibrations with the delta 5128 project; others are done inconsistently, with different couplers and units, all jumbled up.

The measurements should only be used with reference with others in the same database.

## oratory1990 (711)

Mostly focused on headphone measurements, but IEM measurements are also available and are measured using a HATS. Relatively sparse and measurements are not available for download or modification, but are of very high quality.

## PEQdB (5128 & 711)

A scrape of available measurements from squig.link, but without any of the categorization or separation. To be avoided for the most part as other measurement are as accessible while being traceable.
