# Additional Tools

## [PragmaticAudio -izer Tools](https://www.pragmaticaudio.com/iems/)
Three tools - visualizer, subjectizer, treblizer - are available in the equalizer tab. The treblizer is arguably the most useful of the three, allowing users to dial in their treble EQ using sine sweeps.

## [kr0mka's Squig](https://kr0mka.squig.link/)
An interactive EQ can be found under the Equalizer tab. The filters are visualized differently than the one from PragmaticAudio's vizualiser: each filter is superposed on the IEM's FR. Use single/double clicks and scroll wheel to change the filter parameters.

## [How To Listen](https://harmanhowtolisten.blogspot.com/2011/01/welcome-to-how-to-listen.html)
Training program with various tests used for training listeners in Harman research. Reports of compatibility issues are common.

In order to qualify as a "trained listener" in "old" papers, successfully completing level 8 in all tests is required. A change was made such that the "trained listener" qualification could be obtained without doing these tests.

The hardest test (and currently the one being mostly used in Harman training) is the peaks and dips test.

## [Listener's EQ Playground](https://listener.squig.link/eqplayground/)
A squig.link database that does not have any measurements; instead, an extensive collection of targets and curves for various rigs is available, alongside extensive EQ features for EQ development and testing.

## [UsyTrace](https://usyless.uk/trace/)
Useful for obtaining FR data from images and other resources. Works best with a good image: acceptable resolution, clear and "true" axes, distinct FR line.

1. Find and import the image of the FR graph. **The FR curve should ideally be already highlighted in red**
  1*. If the FR is not well selected, use the "Select Trace" option in the left sidebar to optimize the FR curve selection
3. Place the vertical green lines on the 20 Hz and 20 kHz graph lines
	2*. If 20 Hz/kHz are not visible, place the green lines on the lowest and highest frequency graph lines
4. Place the horizontal blue lines on the lowest and highest amplitude (ie dB) lines
  3*. The FR should be contained between the lowest and highest lines
5. In the left sidebar, input the frequency and amplitude limit values
6. Export the trace

## [Owliophile](https://owliophile.com/)
Powerful tool for generating different noises and other sounds. There is also a built-in EQ with real-time feedback for generated sounds and user-uploaded music. The FAQ relates to headphones, and also contains some false notions for which some are covered in the [Myths & Misconceptions](https://4ciemg.github.io/IEM-EQ-Guide/myths-misconceptions/) section. The EQ function is similar to what is covered in the guide.
