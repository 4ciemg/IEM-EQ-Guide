## [UsyTrace](https://usyless.uk/trace/)
Useful for obtaining FR data from images and other resources. Works best with a good image: acceptable resolution, clear and "true" axes, distinct FR line.

1. Find and import the image of the FR graph. **The FR curve should ideally be already highlighted in red**
  1*. If the FR is not well selected, use the "Select Trace" option in the left sidebar to optimize the FR curve selection
3. Place the vertical green lines on the 20 Hz and 20 kHz graph lines
	2*. If 20 Hz/kHz are not visible, place the green lines on the lowest and highest frequency graph lines
4. Place the horizontal blue lines on the lowest and highest amplitude (ie dB) lines
  3*. The FR should be contained between the lowest and highest lines
5. In the left sidebar, input the frequency and amplitude limit values
6. Export the trace
